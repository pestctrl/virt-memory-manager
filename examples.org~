* Questions
** Less important
*** What are the min and max variables?
*** Do we need to service each process concurrently?
** What is the word size? Is it byte addressable?
** Do we need to page the page table and segment table?
** Generate physical addresses for tables?
** What does the size of the process have to do with anything?
   Is it the memory it allocates?
** The logical addresses should theoretically be able to overlap right?
   0x1A logical will point to 2 different places on 2 processes
*** If that's the case, why are we given 8 bit addresses when processes only allocate 16 pages?
    16 pages, should only need 4 bits
    4 bit page table
    maps to 16 physical addresses?
*** Should the main memory set be global?
** Is the stupid sample input file truncated?
** I'm still confused about the physical addressing. 
*** How big should our physical address be?
* Example 1
Total pages in main memory: 12
Maximum Segment Length: 4
Page size: 16 bytes
Number of page frames per process: 4
X: 4
min: 4 ???????
max: 8 ???????
p: 3
